# Let's Do first App OOP Ruby
# Start Project with init file can see two classes Student & ClassRoom
# Student have (name , age , address , phone , class_room_id )
#   class_room_id: Should Related ClassRoom id and that must be related id from ClassRoom
# and I can Call by method in @student.get_class_room call ClassRoom
#
# ClassRoom (id , name)
#   id => auto calculate
#   name => Accept any String
#
#
# Let's Do our story
#
#
# - Will run init file like (ruby init.rb)
# and Show (Wellcome in School System Please Add how many your Classes Room)
# when andd like 4 will insert 4 times ClassesRoom and open All Classes Room and say what's count students in that class room
# and when add 4 stduents make 4 times for insert etc ect until finsh all calsses room
#
# and now I can exit from App if make "exit" as string
# or make search student when write "search"
# or make insert new classroom when write "insert_new_class_room" with students
# or make insert new student with choice class_room when write "insert_new_student"
